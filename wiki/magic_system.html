                    Magic is conducted via a series of 
                    emotes. Usually it takes between 2-4 
                    emotes to cast a spell depending on the 
                    level of that spell and proficiency.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        An emote to channel the magic aura 
                        must be done. If you are casting 
                        magic outside of combat, this must 
                        be done first.
                    </li><li>
                        The number of emotes used to cast a 
                        spell may vary depending on the 
                        user's proficiency of the spell, 
                        and difficulty level of the spell.
                    </li><li>
                        Roll for hit and damage. Modifiers 
                        are added for rolls depending on 
                        power, items, proficiency, etc... 
                        The defending mage may attempt to 
                        block or deflect the spell, and will 
                        have to roll as well.

                    Magic is catergorized into 3 groups: 
                    Incantations, Sorcery, and Alchemic.
                </p><p> 
                    Each group is further split into 
                    subcatergories as shown below.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-coloured"><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-sparkles"></i> Incantations</h2>
                <p>
                    Incantations are abstract in nature and 
                    call upon both natural and spiritual 
                    elements.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-coloured">Miracles</h3>
                <p>
                    Similar to dark souls, miracles are a 
                    type of incantation that has godly 
                    principles, able to drawn on power 
                    depending on one's faith and belief.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Blessings</b> are buffs that may be 
                    given to any living creature (creatures 
                    considered living are those with a 
                    soul).
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Restorations</b> can heal injuries, 
                    both physical and spiritual.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Weapons of Faith</b> are versatile 
                    auras that the user may summon, ranging 
                    from defensive, offensive, or support. 
                    Some examples of this are armour, 
                    swords, or even wings.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-coloured">Pyromancy</h3>
                <p>
                    Summoning the elemental power of fire 
                    is conducted via incantation.
                </p><p>
                    Magic fire is hard to control, but it 
                    is flexible and can be wielded in many 
                    ways. The most common use of pyromancy 
                    is melding fire into projectiles such as 
                    fireballs or spears.
                </p><p>
                    However, pyromancy is not limited to 
                    offensive measures, and may be used in 
                    defensive situations.
                </p><p>
                    There are different types of fire that may 
                    be channeled by a user. The only lawful 
                    flame in Luthwardron is <b>holy fire</b>.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-coloured">Eldritch Incantations</h3>
                <p>
                    Magic that is drawn from the faith and 
                    belief in a powerful entity. Most often 
                    eldritch incantations are a mix of 
                    miracles and elemental magics.
                </p><p>
                    This magic has been outlawed as taboo 
                    in Luthwardron.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-coloured">Spiritual Incantations</h3>
                <p>
                    Drawing upon the power of spirits, 
                    ghosts, or creatures.

                    This magic is forbidden to students.
                </p>

                    <b class="text-coloured">Druid Magic</b> relates to the 
                    nature of the world and is drawn 
                    by the power of life.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Bardmancy</b> is drawn from stories 
                    to instill positive emotions in allies 
                    or negative emotions in enemies. It is 
                    often used by bards as a dramatic flair 
                    in shows, hence the name.
                </p>
                <hr class="break2">
                <h2 class="text-coloured"><i class="fa-solid fa-wand-sparkles"></i> Sorcery</h2>
                <p>
                    The use of advanced techniques to refine 
                    natural elements into tools and weapons. 
                </p><p>
                    Incantations are the primordial form of 
                    magic, relying on faith. Sorcery relies 
                    on a deeper understanding of the world 
                    and its workings.
                </p><p>
                    That being said, Sorcery can be drawn by 
                    a multitude of sources. It is typically 
                    drawn from a concept that can be studied 
                    and formulated.
                </p><p>
                    The power of sorcery may be multiplied 
                    by objects such as rings and staffs.
                </p><p>
                    Sorcery is commonly drawn from 
                    starlight, moonlight, dark light, and 
                    elemental sources. Often a mix is used 
                    for spells.

                <h3 class="text-coloured">Offensive Sorcery</h3>

                    <b class="text-coloured">Projectiles</b> are the most common 
                    type of offensive magic. It may be 
                    molded into many shapes such as arrows, 
                    boulders, and the like.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Conjurations</b> take the shape of 
                    weapons and acts in similar ways to 
                    projectiles. Conjured weapons and tools 
                    can hold the shape and properties of 
                    their summoned form until it wears down 
                    or the sorcerer is unable to hold it.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Wards</b> are magical barriers that 
                    can be summoned to deflect or block 
                    incoming attacks.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Elemental</b> magic such as ice, 
                    lightning, water, and others can be 
                    summoned. Elements are often used as 
                    projectiles.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Storms</b> are a form of magic that 
                    summons large auras of magic that harms 
                    whoever steps inside.

                <h3 class="text-coloured">Domestic Sorcery</h3>
                <p>
                    Sorcery that is not used for the 
                    improvement of life rather than for 
                    combat.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Conjuration</b> may be a form of 
                    domestic sorcery. A great understanding 
                    of the conjured object must be achieved 
                    for it to be proper.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Illusion Craft</b> uses sources of 
                    light and elements to cast illusions of 
                    things that are not there. Unlike 
                    conjugations, Illusions only require 
                    visual understanding. They do not hold 
                    up to physical contact like 
                    conjurations.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Dark Light</b> manipulates objects. 
                    Objects can be made to float or fly, or 
                    be tossed about. It is useful for
                    travel and labor.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Enchantment</b> imbues objects with 
                    magic. Some examples of this are wards 
                    to protect the object, or programmed 
                    spells that can be slung from swords.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Charm Crafting</b> is similar to 
                    enchantment. Charms are talismans that 
                    enhance magical power. They are hard to 
                    make as each must be fine tuned to the 
                    specific person. If multiple are 
                    used without calculating their effects 
                    it can lead to bad results such as 
                    sudden combustion.

                    alter oneself with magic to improve the 
                    senses. It is possible to use 
                    altercation to see and feel things 
                    previously unable to be.
