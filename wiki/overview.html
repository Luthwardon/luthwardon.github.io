                        The Universe, oft referred to by the 
                        scholars of old as The Divinity.
                    </p><p>
                        The Divinity encompasses all of this; 
                        All sects of this plane. No corner 
                        untouched.
                    </p><p>
                        The Divinity is above all intellect. Its 
                        reason is beyond all mind. That is all it 
                        can ever be.
                    </p><p>
                        The Realms of this plane are vast. Vivid 
                        spectrums of unintelligible distance- whose comprehension spells madness, if not death, for any mortal mind.
                    </p><p>
                        At the center of this Realm, lies a Nexus. 
                        A transcendental hub of;
                    </p><p>
                        Power;
                    </p><p>
                        Life;
                    </p><p>
                        Good;
                    </p><p>
                        Evil;
                    </p><p>
                        And all other things that can be 
                        understood. This center is known as 
                        Luthwardron.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr class="break1"><p>
                    Luthwardron is the gathering point for 
                    many things. All roads that travel across 
                    The Divinity tend to begin, and end, in 
                    Luthwardron. Missing people, oft find 
                    themselves wandering its streets. Lost 
                    souls gather among its graves. Those 
                    without purpose tend to find it within 
                    the now-lively Kingdoms- But it was not 
                    always this way. Eons ago, time 
                    immemorial, Luthwardron was, as it is 
                    now, the Nexus for all things- and by 
                    virtue of this- it was a Realm of War.
                </p><p>
                    Forces of such power, that merely 
                    speaking their long-forgotten names is of 
                    grave danger to the mortal man- did fierce 
                    battle on the grounds of Luthwardron. 
                </p><p>
                    One force rose above the rest.
                </p><p>
                    The Dark Lord. 
                </p><p>
                    The Harbinger of Doom. 
                </p><p>
                    The Limit of Evil.
                </p><p>
                    Known by name, to only his most loyal 
                    servants, as the High King Rafaent. 
                    <small>
                        [placeholder evil name]. 
                        (subject for change).

                </p><p>
                    The Primordial Evil was a creature born 
                    of uncertainty- from the most vile of 
                    mortal emotions- the darkest parts of 
                    every mind- and the one, true fear of all 
                    living things. The Void.
                </p><p>
                    His reign was painted with horror. His 
                    cunning and awe-inspiring power brought 
                    the realm of Luthwardron to its knees- 
                    but Crimson was not satisfied. His hunger 
                    was unquenched, and he reached outwards. 
                    During this time, dubbed The Antiquity of 
                    Crimson's reign, vast sums of potential 
                    were dragged to Luthwardron. 
                </p><p>
                    What was once a war-torn land, was 
                    fertilized by the blood of its combatants. 

                </p><p>
                    Crimson's hunger was his own undoing- an 
                    ironic fate- as his lust for power brought 
                    about the righteous climate for The Birth.
                </p><p>
                    Once, just once, every eon- the stars 
                    align. The Divinity orders itself as it 
                    once was; perfect. In that perfection, 
                    though lasting no more than an instant, 
                    potential was seeded into the ground of 
                    Luthwardron. The fertilized ground, 
                    watered by the tears of the damned- gave 
                    the perfect climate from which The Vessel 
                    of God was born. 
                </p><p>
                    Its name was enough to drive back the 
                    forces of evil- and its gift was pure. 
                    The Vessel of God bestowed upon the many 
                    inhabitants of Luthwardron a power so 
                    crucial- so terrifying to the Dark Lord- 
                    The Vessel bestowed hope. Magicks 
                    blossomed like wildflowers- rapidly 
                    covering Luthwardron. With the power 
                    given to them by The Vessel, the poor 
                    slaves of Crimson began one last war. 
                </p><p>
                    Man, Elf, Dwarf, Imp, and all other life 
                    revolted against the Darkness- and in the 
                    end, brought death to its master.

                        [place holder name for the big bad

                    </small>
                    was defeated.
                </p><hr class="break2"><p>
                    As it would have, power finds itself at 
                    the heart of all motion in The Divinity. 
                    After the fall of [evil guy], the three 
                    races which had become most adept with 
                    the powerful magicks each formed their 
                    own Kingdoms- and together, thrust 
                    Luthwardron into its Golden Age. Two 
                    Kingdoms of Man- The Greater Luethenia, 
                    and The Lesser Cyrianopolis. The Kingdom 
                    of Dwarves- Horkraum. And The Kingdom of 
                    the Elves- Fynnstaefum.
                </p><p>
                    For many gilded ages, the four kingdoms 
                    prospered. Wealth and Power accumulated, 
                    Knowledge flourished, and the Magicks 
                    that had become so crucial to their 
                    freedom were honed.
                </p><p>
                    The Golden Age gave birth to many of the 
                    Realm's greatest legends. Heroes were 
                    born, and earned their name hunting down 
                    the remnant forces of 
                    <small>[big bad evil guy]</small>.
                </p><p>
                    Pride came before the fall.
                </p><p>
                    The two Kingdoms of Man- once bound 
                    together, akin to brothers- separated. 
                    They bickered for dwindling land grants- 
                    and the once rich soils of Luthwardron 
                    became dry. The Dwarves dug deeper than 
                    they ever had- allured by the riches 
                    hidden within the earth. The Elves 
                    secluded themselves, distancing themselves 
                    from whom they deemed, lesser races. 
                </p><p>
                    War broke out among the Human Kingdoms. 
                    Insults turned to skirmishes- Skirmishes 
                    to battles- Battles to bloodshed- and 
                    Bloodshed- to desperation. 
                </p><p>
                    The King of Cyrianopolis, The Honored 
                    Viktos, watched as his Kingdom was laid 
                    to waste. His court was murdered. His 
                    family taken. Relying on his most trusted 
                    advisors, Viktos led one final prayer in 
                    the innermost chambers of his Castle. 
                </p><p>
                    An ancient ritual, a sacrifice, to call 
                    upon the Divinity- to bring Salvation and 
                    Peace- a legend so old, its true purpose 
                    had become buried.
                </p><p>
                    The King, driven to desperation, plunged a 
                    sullen, black blade into his heart.
                </p><p>
                    His most trusted advisor, Okhaust of 
                    Cyrian, had won. The Ritual would save 
                    only one Kingdom, and it would not be 
                    Viktos'.

                    Cyrianopolis sank into the depths- the 
                    power forged in the Ritual too strong for 
                    the weakened earth to bare- and the earth 
                    swallowed it whole- closing the ground 
                    beneath it, for ages to come. 
                </p><hr class="break2"><p>
                    At the same moment as the fall of 
                    Cyrianopolis- the Dwarven King, Hakread, 
                    driven to near-insanity by his 
                    all-too-dwarven greed, split the earth, 
                    leagues below the surface. A blackness, 
                    which swallowed even the light from their 
                    torches, stared back at the Dwarven King. 
                    How cunning was the Dark lord, to leave 
                    this, for the dwarves to find. The Dwarven 
                    King, realizing the Rapture he had brought 
                    about, led one final act of Dwarven 
                    Courage. With all the might of his 
                    forefathers, King Hakread plummeted his 
                    Kingdom into the earth- to serve as the 
                    only seal between unimaginable horrors, 
                    and the surface-world he hadn't seen in 
                    years.

                    Horkraum was buried, along with many of 
                    its peoples and heroes.

                    The secluded elven city was the last to 
                    be touched by this fateful moment. For, 
                    at the same moment as the Human and 
                    Dwarven Kingdoms fell, an order was 
                    signed into motion by the Elven Liege.
                </p><p>
                    Ages ago, there were more than the 
                    fair-skinned elves we know today. There 
                    were another culture- whom lived 
                    intertwined in the Elven kingdom. The 
                    White Elves and 'Sullen Elves', as they 
                    were called in the later days of the 
                    Golden Age. 
                </p><p>
                    The Elven Liege, in a time of great 
                    tension, ordered the execution of all 
                    Sullen Elves.
                </p><p>
                    More blood soaked the land.  
                </p><hr class="break2"><p>
                    Luethenia was the last of the Old 
                    Kingdoms to fall. 
                </p><p>
                    Lured by the prospect of reclaiming their 
                    lost birthrights- Dwarven and Human forces 
                    plunged their city of Orvandy into the 
                    earth. The misguided citystate dug for 
                    many years- and, ironically, by the hand 
                    of the old Dawrven King's lineage, the 
                    lost Kingdom of Cryianopolis was uncovered. 
                    Its riches had spoiled, and its peoples 
                    had decayed- but even deeper within the 
                    chasm- the festering hatred of Okhaust 
                    was fed new life. His power of unmatched- 
                    he was quick to destroy the forces that 
                    had freed his imprisonment within the 
                    earth. Orvandy fell before the sun set- 
                    many fleeing- and those who had not, being 
                    killed. 
                </p><p>
                    Okhaust was quick to act- besieging the 
                    dying Kingdom of Luethenia mere weeks 
                    after his revival. Their crops dead, 
                    Magicks dwindling, and provinces lost- 
                    Luethenia fell to Okhaust.
                </p><p>
                    The self-proclaimed Demon King burned a 
                    path of destruction straight into the last 
                    Kingdom of man. Okhaust's march saw the 
                    end of Luethenia. The Demon King laid 
                    waste to all- rapturing the great 
                    mountains of Luthwardron- covering the 
                    Realm is a sullen smog and ash.
                </p><hr class="break2"><p>
                    For ages forlorn, Okhaust ruled. The 
                    actions of his reign, to this day, leave 
                    wanderlost souls and spirits- cursed to 
                    roam the land of Luthwardron. Okhaust's 
                    reign, the Ashen Fall <small>(name 
                    subject to change)</small>, returned the 
                    land to a low-point it had seen only once 
                    before. The bloodsoaked lands cried out 
                    for salvation- nightly prayers cast into 
                    the heavens above.
                </p><p>
                    And from the heavens above, came their 
                    savior.
                </p><p>
                    Some say he descended from the stars on a 
                    chariot of light.
                </p><p>
                    Other accounts claim he sailed a great 
                    vessel across an aurora.
                </p><p>
                    It matters not by what mode he arrived 
                    on- but merely the fact he did.
                </p><p>
                    Alstalta, the second Vessel of God, 
                    brought with him a gift the peoples of 
                    Luthwardron so desperately needed. 
                </p><p>
                    The same gift the first Vessel had 
                    brought. 
                </p><p>
                    Hope. 
                </p><p>
                    From this hope, a new age of Magicks 
                    dawned on Luthwardron. Once again, like 
                    eons past, the Vessel of God led a 
                    ferocious battle against evil- and as 
                    fate would have it, defeated Okhaust. In 
                    the end, neither survived. Alstalta 
                    ultimately sacrificed himself to seal the 
                    Mountains Okhaust had split open- freeing 
                    the land of its ashen curse.
                </p><p>
                    Of course, that's just what the believers 
                    say. 
                </p><p>
                    No man truly knows. 
                </p><hr class="break2"><p>
                    Luthwardron is an empire of Man- thriving 
                    upon the prosperity brought by peacetimes- 
                    “Pax Luthwardria”. The Magicks flourish, 
                    as do the cultures of our Land. Tales of 
                    demonic armies and ashen winters are 
                    frowned upon. Naught more than children's 
                    stories- or, perhaps, were. In recent 
                    days, any mention of The Vessel of God, 
                    or The Demon King, Okhaust, are silenced 
                    by those in power. Protecting the 
                    Empire, from false truths, they claim.
                </p><p>
                    Many of us Scholars, hidden in our 
                    studies, far from the Empire's grasp, 
                    still speak the untold knowledge of our 
                    forefathers. 
                </p><p>
                    The Ceaseless Wheel spins, despite man's 
                    best efforts to stop it.
