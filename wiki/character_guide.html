                    During open host, you do not have to 
                    calculate character stats, and instead 
                    will be given a basic set of stats. The 
                    character creation is optional for 
                    people who want to keep their progress.
                </p><p>
                    When you make a character, you will get 
                    some stats to devote points into. It 
                    will be kept simple and the rp won't 
                    heavily depend on stats.
                </p><p>
                    Similar to D&D, you will roll an amount 
                    equal to the amount of starting 
                    categories. You can put the numbers you 
                    roll into any category. You can also get 
                    a few +1 stat bonus depending on your 
                    origin of your character.
