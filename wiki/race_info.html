                    Human</h2>
                <p>
                    Humans are the most populace race, 
                    driven by their ambition to become 
                    adaptable in nearly any condition.

                    <b class="text-coloured">Luethenians</b> 
                    are those born in the heart of 
                    Luthwardron. They are born with strong 
                    proficiency in holy magics.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Outlanders</b> 
                    are those hailing from foreign lands, 
                    not yet subdued by Luthwardron. They 
                    are born with strong proficiency in 
                    spiritual incantations.

                    Dwarf</h2>
                <p>
                    A dying race in Luthwardron, they live 
                    in small sanctuary throughout the 
                    lands, having lost their homelands long 
                    ago.
                </p><p>

                    Half-Elf</h2>
                <p>
                    The original elves are long since gone 
                    from the lands of Luthwardron, but 
                    remnants of their existence persist in 
                    the form of half-elves. Often hailing 
                    from noble blood, half-elves are 
                    slightly more proficient at all magic 
                    and slightly stronger than their human 
                    counterparts.

                    They are born of human blood that has 
                    been tainted by demonic influence. They 
                    are banished deep beneath the earth for 
                    their unholy ties, in the under realm. 
                    Tieflings are naturally gifted in 
                    pyromancy, and they also are gifted in 
                    specific elemental magic, depending on 
                    their blood.
                </p><p>
                    Tieflings are persecuted on the surface, 
                    and if exposed by any authority their 
                    sentence is death.

                    living in small shire communes 
                    throughout the land. They are naturally 
                    gifted in brewery and have some 
                    improved strength in spiritual magic.
