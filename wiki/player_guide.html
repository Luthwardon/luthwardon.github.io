                <p>
                    There are things to do scattered 
                    throughout Luthwardron. Some may be 
                    locked depending on your actions, 
                    affiliations, race, etc.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-coloured">Quests</h3>
                <p>
                    Some NPCs will give out quests for 
                    players. Most quests will give you a 
                    book with a list of objectives to 
                    complete. How you complete these 
                    objectives is up to you.
                </p><p>
                    <b>Big quests</b> 
                    will have to be overseen by a DM, due to 
                    interactions and events during those 
                    quests. For these quests a party is 
                    needed.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-coloured">Dungeons</h3>
                <p>
                    Scattered throughout the land will be 
                    dungeons that you can progress through. 
                    At the end there is loot to be had that 
                    your character can then use, as well as 
                    “level ups” to increase your stats. Some 
                    forts and other structures can act as 
                    dungeons if you decide to attack them. 
                    Quests may have dungeons attached to 
                    them.
                </p><p>
                    <b>A DM is required to oversee 
                    encounters in dungeons</b>
                </p><p>
                    Some dungeons and boss rooms will not 
                    fit on the plot. In that case there 
                    will be another plot where the dungeon 
                    / boss room will be built.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-coloured">Encounters</h3>
                <p>
                    There are lots of NPC armor stands 
                    throughout the land of Luthwardron. You 
                    may interact with them as you want. 
                    However, there are a few exceptions.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Shopkeepers</b> 
                    sell items and tools. To purchase stuff 
                    from them you must contact a DM if they 
                    are online.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Guards & Soldiers</b> 
                    may be killed. 
                    You must get a DM to oversee this. If 
                    not planned out, you may get swarmed by 
                    guards. The DM will act out the actions 
                    of the NPCs you are fighting.
                </p><p>
                    <b class="text-coloured">Monsters</b> may 
                    be encountered in the wilderness. There 
                    will be some signs in front of 
                    creatures in caves and places. If the 
                    sign is in hallway you must fight those 
                    creatures in order to pass. There will 
                    be a build/armor stand there as well 
                    attempting to depict the monsters. If 
                    the monsters require a DM, it will be 
                    stated on the sign.
